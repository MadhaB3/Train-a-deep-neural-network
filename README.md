#Explore data with NumPy and Pandas

A significant part of a data scientist's role is to explore, analyze, and visualize data. There's a wide range of tools and programming languages that they can use to do this, and of the most popular approaches is to use Jupyter notebooks (like this one) and Python.

Python is a flexible programming language that is used in a wide range of scenarios; from web applications to device programming. It's extremely popular in the data science and machine learning community because of the many packages it supports for data analysis and visualization.
